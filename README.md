Daily News is a news app about war in ukraine, built on the previous semester of my IT studies to get a grade from one of the subject.
I used there mainly react and redux for state management.
There are also some animation build with framer-motion.

User can read about newest events, thumbs up posts if is logged and check place of event on the map.
As a admin you can add, delete and edit posts.
